# CS3500
homeworks from Northeastern's Object-Oriented Design course

The homeworks are broken up into three major sections:
HW1 is an intro to the course, separate from the other projects
HW2-4 builds a game called freecell (details and rules can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell)
HW5-7 builds an image editor that can perform basic operations on images
